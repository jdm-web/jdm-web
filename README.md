### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## My name is Jeremy
### and Iâ€™m a freelance web production expert

#### I help companies structure, pilot or develop their web projects.

#### Iâ€™m a passionate Full Stack Developer too.

I have the chance to have made my hobby a full-time job. **I love the web**, Iâ€™m always eager to learn new techniques, exchange with fellow developers and get better together.

I started coding 15 years ago and hungrily carried on with tools and techniques, concepts such as **#DevOps**, **#security**, **#accessibility**, **#SEO**, **#industrialization**, **#green IT**, and many more as you could see on my [about page](https://jdmweb.com/about/).

One day youâ€™ll find me doing **#backend** code on a project, the other some **#Barba + GSAP animations** on another one, someday youâ€™ll bump into me speaking at a [meetup or a conference](https://speakerdeck.com/jdmweb), or maybe youâ€™ll read one of my [blog](https://jdmweb.com/blog/) posts, [online course](https://jdmweb.com/how-to-get-the-best-out-of-your-development-team-landing/), or [tweet](https://twitter.com/jdmweb). Whatever the circumstances, Iâ€™m sure that would not be very far from the web.
